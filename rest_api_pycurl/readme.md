**Curl**
- cURL is a command-line tool for getting or sending data including files using URL syntax.
- CUrl uses libcurl which supports common network protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP Requests, FTP, TFTP, LDAP etc
- cURL supports HTTPS and performs SSL certificate verification by default when a secure protocol is specified such as HTTPS.
- When cURL connects to a remote server via HTTPS, it will obtain the remote server certificate, then check against its CA certificate store the validity of the remote server to ensure the remote server is the one it claims to be.
